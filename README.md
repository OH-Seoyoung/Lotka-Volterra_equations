- Jul. 1, 2021 ~ Dec. 1, 2021

----------
- The Lotka-Volterra equations are a system of two first-order, nonlinear ODEs that describe the populations of predators and prey in a biological system. Over time, the populations of the predators and prey change according to the equations :  
  
<sup>dx</sup>/<sub>dt</sub> = &alpha; x - &beta; xy  
<sup>dy</sup>/<sub>dt</sub> = &delta; xy - &gamma; y
